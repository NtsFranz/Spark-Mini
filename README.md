# Spark Mini
Mobile version of the Spark

**IF YOU ARE ON WINDOWS, USE THE MAIN SPARK INSTEAD: https://github.com/NtsFranz/Spark**

Application for non-Windows clients. Won't be able to have a lot of the features of the main Spark, but hopefully still can be useful to people.
Windows clients can run EchoVR itself, allowing for a larger feature set.
